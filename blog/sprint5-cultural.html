        <h1>Foundations Reflection</h1>
        <h2>Core Skills</h2>
        <h3>02/10/2020</h3>
        
        <p>
          Our curriculum over the past 5 weeks has not only put emphasis on how essential core skills are in our day to day lives, but also as workers in the tech industry. Employers, and colleagues, are looking to work with people that have high EQ, who are great team players and communicators. Prior to beginning my study at EDA, I already began meeting and speaking with people who work in tech as software/web developers and recruiters. Their emphasis on core skills intrigued me, and I thought to myself that I already have good skills in this area due to past work experience, but further developing these core skills would be highly beneficial for my career. I was pleased to see the emphasis on core skills at EDA, as it reflected what I had been hearing from people right in the industry. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Throughout foundations, I had the opportunity to reflect and learn about myself. I felt that I always approached my study with a positive attitude, and that I was taking responsibility for my study and learning outcomes. I was able to develop my focus and productivity with the use of a pomodoro timer while working. While foundations has mainly been a solo effort, I understand how core skills apply in tech in a collaborative working environment. It is important to communicate clearly in order for jobs to be completed properly. This involves active listening and engaging in the conversation, and can including looping. By being compassionate we can get the best out of our peers and build each other up.

        <h2>Preparing for Bootcamp</h2>
        <h4><em>"What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?"</em></h4>
        <p>
          I want to further my education with programming to have more career opportunities. I need a solid job with solid pay. Programming appears to have a lot of potential for freelance work, I would love to have the option to tap into that. There are amazing Music Technology companies in New Zealand that I would also love to work with. I am also interested in e-commerce and retail/wholesale technology solutions. NZ is not short on those either!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4><em>"What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?"</em></h4>
        <p>
          My biggest strengths during bootcamp could be my tenacity and creativity. I might struggle with the learning pace in some subjects.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4><em>"What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?"</em></h4>
        <p>
          Potentially feeling burnt out. I will be doing my best to manage that.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4><em>"What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?"</em></h4>
        <p>
          I would like to develop my communication, interpersonal, and leadership skills. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4><em>"What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp"</em></h4>
        <p>
          Maintain positive habits, timekeeping, and communicate and reach out for help when struggling, technical or non-technical! I will strive to help others when I can. I will need to be dedicated and accountable as it won't just be my study or work on the line. There will be instances during bootcamp where our cohort will rely on one another.
          <br>
          <br>
          I look forward to being at the Bootcamp, where I can meet my cohort and we can all learn and build each other up.
